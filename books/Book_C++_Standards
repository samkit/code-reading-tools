Chapter 2. Lexical Conventions
    Translation unit is a source file including all the headers and source files by '#include' directive
    2.13.4 Literals
         6. string literals are treated as "array of n const char" and has static storage duration.
        10. string literals with same value can or cannot be pointing to same memory location. (implementation defined)

Chapter 3. Basic concepts
    3.2 One definition rule
        3. Inline function's defition should be present in every translation unit
        5. Definition of an implicitly defined constructor appears in every translation unit. (Let say compared to one definition when given in another translation unit. Increases code size and blotting.)

    3.3 Declarative regions and scopes
        2. Scope v/s potential scope

        3.3.1 Point of declaration (good examples of where the actual declarations start)
            8. The point of declaration of a function-local predefined variable is immediately before the function-body of a function definition.

        3.3.2
